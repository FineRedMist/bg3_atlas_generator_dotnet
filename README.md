# bg3_atlas_generator_dotnet
Commandline C# tool to generate an atlas and supporting files for Baldur's Gate 3 mods

In the process of trying to create my own mod, I needed some tooling to generate my own icons.

While the mod I was working on (an attempt to implement the D&D Epic 6 leveling model) has hit an impasse, publishing some of the tooling that illustrates how to perform some of the functionality in question is useful.

This library relies on the following additional modules:

* https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp
